#region Step 2: Configure environment

string googleApiKey = ""; //todo - store this securely and not in source code!
string embeddingModelName = "";

#endregion

#region Step 3: Install needed NuGet Packages

//todo - Google.GenAI (For the Gemini Connection)
//todo - Microsoft.Agents.AI (For the Agent)
//todo - CommunityToolkit.VectorData.InMemory (For VectorStore)

#region Step 4: Create you Embedding Generator

Client client = new Google.GenAI.Client(apiKey: googleApiKey);
IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> embeddingGenerator = client
    .AsIEmbeddingGenerator(embeddingModelName);

#region Step 5: Create your Vector Model class

//Create C# Class with Key, Data and Vector (Add relevant attributes)

#region Step 6: Create you VectorStore (with Embedding Generator in options) and collection (and ensure it exist)

VectorStore store = new InMemoryVectorStore(new InMemoryVectorStoreOptions

VectorStoreCollection<string, VectorModel> collection = store.GetCollection<string, VectorModel>("myCollection");

#region Step 9: Build and use Agent
